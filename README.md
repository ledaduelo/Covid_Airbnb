# Covid_Airbnb
This is the analysis on which the medium's post is based...
What happened to the rents that are on Airbnb during the covid?  
The data is the apartments for months I have downloaded the data from February to April 2019 and 2020 to see what has happened

In mid-March, quarantines and border closures began in Europe to deal with COVID. 
How has this quarantine affected Airbnb's supply? The wired indicates that they are moving to long-term rental sites 

Question 1: without tourism, What happened to tourist rentals?
Question two: Is the behaviour homogeneous or does any of the characteristics of the rentals take precedence?
you look at how the rentals behave in your area (neighbourhood) or your level (price) or according to the type of host

# Data
I compare the March and April data from Airbnb inside for Madrid.
379 rentals have been lost from Airbnb Madrid during the quarantine and the average price has increased by 8.5 euros.


# Analysis
The graphics show us that the changes are not homogeneous. 
Therefore, it is relevant to classify by levels some of the characteristics of the rents to see the impact on price change.


#Insights
* The changes are very light
* Rents have disappeared, mostly from whole houses. 
* Prices have risen slightly but in neighborhoods with the lowest price level and number of rents
* The downtown neighborhoods have adjusted prices the most
* It's the new hostels that have changed the price.
