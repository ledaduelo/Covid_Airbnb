# Covid_Airbnb

# The goal
This is the analysis on which the medium's post is based... What happened to the rents that are on Airbnb during the covid? 

In mid-March, quarantines and border closures began in Europe to deal with COVID. 
How has this quarantine affected Airbnb's supply? The wired indicates that they are moving to long-term rental sitesÂ 

* **Question 1**: without tourism, What happened to tourist rentals?
* **Question 2**: Is the behaviour homogeneous or does any of the characteristics of the rentals take precedence?
you look at how the rentals behave in your area (neighbourhood) or your level (price).
* **Question 3**: Is the behavior of all host homogeneous?
Understand the type of host and how each guest has behaved in the face of uncertainty

# Project motivation
Some articles published in the press in the UK and comments on twitter where there were signs that Airbnb apartments were beginning to move to rental websites.
I wanted to know what the reality was in Airbnb Madrid

# Data 
The data is the apartments for the moment start the quarentine. I have downloaded the data from March to April 2019 and 2020 to see what has happened
I compare the March and April data from Airbnb inside for Madrid.


# Libraries use
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

# Analysis
The graphics show us that the changes are not homogeneous. 
Therefore, it is relevant to classify by levels some of the characteristics of the rents to see the impact on price change.


# Insights & Summary of the results
* The changes are very light
* Prices have risen slightly but in neighborhoods with the lowest price level and number of rents
* The downtown neighborhoods have adjusted prices the most
* It's the new hostels that have changed the price.
